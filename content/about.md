This site was built by [bcspragu](https://github.com/bcspragu/) (and hopefully others soon!) using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and a few other bits and bobs from around the Internet, see [the source repository](https://github.com/bcspragu/thesmallestweb) for more details.

## What's, like, your plan here?

The plan is pretty straightforward, this site aims to provide resources for both beginners and more experienced web folks to:

* Deploy small, secure applications for their own personal use
* Leverage and contribute to open-source software
* Have fun, and show a new side to what the Internet can be

Of course, the site does none of these things yet, but one step at a time!

## Interest piqued?

If the (vague, shifty) ideas of the Smallest Web interest you, let me know! I'm always happy to bounce ideas around and want to make this site as great a resource as it can be.
