# The Smallest Web

This repo contains what will eventually become thesmallestweb.com, a site dedicated to the smallest, most personal parts of The Small Web.

It's a [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) site with no JavaScript and a no-frills custom theme (just called `minimal` here). It's based on [modern-normalize](https://github.com/sindresorhus/modern-normalize), and takes Hugo-specific cues from [hugo-PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) and [awesome-motherfucking-website](https://github.com/lyoshenka/awesome-motherfucking-website).
