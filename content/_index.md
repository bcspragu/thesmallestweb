The Smallest Web is about carving out a small corner of the Internet that is purely your own. It could be where you keep your grocery list, share stories with friends, or store your books.

The Smallest Web is based on [The](https://benhoyt.com/writings/the-small-web-is-beautiful/) [Small](https://neustadt.fr/essays/the-small-web/) [Web](https://ar.al/2020/08/07/what-is-the-small-web/), but, well, even _smaller_. Defintions of "The Small Web" may vary depending on where you look, but generally, the small web features:

- No ads or tracking
- Not monetized
- Not run by a large company
- Meant for individuals or small communities

The Smallest Web is all that too! But it also takes things a bit further:

- Not necessarily on the public internet
- Self-hostable (perhaps even in your house!)
- Small, focused apps
- Open-source software
